# What is Quest Slayer?

The idea of the Quest Slayer is to keep track of life's many quests. Examples like attending a game at every NFL stadium, reading every Stephen King Novel, or beating every Pokemon game are examples of quests that may some day end up on the Quest Slayer. 

My main goal is to someday turn this into a full fledged web application. Due to limited time and resources, I've bootstrapped the project by starting it on a blogging platform. If you (or someone you know) would like to help me realize that dream, send me a Twitter DM ([@Quest_Slayer](https://twitter.com/quest_slayer)). 

# How can I get a Quest added?

The best way to help out would be to create the quest yourself and submit a pull request to my github. You can see what I mean by digging through the Quest Slayer Github. Each json file represents a separate quest. Once that file is filled in, I've made it really easy to have it appear on the Quest Slayer.

The other option is to send me a Twitter DM ([@Quest_Slayer](https://twitter.com/quest_slayer)) with a quest you'd like to see, and I'll see what I can do to add it. 

# Where is my data stored?

What makes this a bit different than most web applications is that all of the user quest information is stored locally on a per browser basis. In a future update, the user will be able to export their data, and import it to another browser/platform. Think of each web browser instance as a separate instance with local storage. 

# How can I help support the Quest Slayer?

The easiest way is to use my Amazon links to buy stuff (most quests have Amazon items associated with them).

You can also just click this and buy something to help us out:  https://www.amazon.com/?tag=quest_conquerer-20&linkCode=ez
