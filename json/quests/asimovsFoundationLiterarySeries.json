	"description": "The Foundation series is a science fiction book series written by American author Isaac Asimov. The premise of the series is that the mathematician Hari Seldon spent his life developing a branch of mathematics known as psychohistory, a concept of mathematical sociology. Using the laws of mass action, it can predict the future, but only on a large scale. These are sorted by the chronological ordering suggested in the 'Author Note' of Prelude to Foundation.",
